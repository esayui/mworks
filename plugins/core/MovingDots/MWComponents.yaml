description: A moving dot field stimulus
parameters: 
  - 
    name: field_radius
    required: yes
    description: Field radius (degrees)
  - 
    name: field_center_x
    required: yes
    description: Field horizontal center position (degrees)
  - 
    name: field_center_y
    required: yes
    description: Field vertical center position (degrees)
  - 
    name: dot_density
    required: yes
    description: Number of dots per square degree
  - 
    name: dot_size
    required: yes
    description: Dot diameter (degrees)
  - 
    name: color
    default: '1.0,1.0,1.0'
    description: >
        Dot color, expressed as a comma-separated list of red, green, and blue
        components.  Each component may be described by any valid expression,
        but the expression must result in a value between 0 and 1 (inclusive).
  - 
    name: alpha_multiplier
    default: 1.0
    description: >
        Controls the transparency of the dots.  ``1.0`` is fully opaque, while
        ``0.0`` is fully tranparent.
  - 
    name: direction
    required: yes
    description: Direction of movement for coherent dots (degrees)
  - 
    name: speed
    required: yes
    description: Dot speed (degrees per second)
  - 
    name: coherence
    default: 1.0
    description: >
        Fraction of dots that move in the specified `direction`_.  Non-coherent
        dots receive random directions.
  - 
    name: lifetime
    default: 0.0
    description: >
        Dot lifetime (seconds).  When a dot reaches the end of its lifetime, it
        is removed and replaced by a new dot in a random location.
  - 
    name: announce_dots
    default: 'NO'
    description: |
        If ``YES``, stimulus announcements (i.e. ``#announceStimulus`` and
        ``#stimDisplayUpdate`` events) will include dot positions.

        Position data is encoded as a binary array of single-precision floating
        point values (in platform `byte order
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness>`_), with each consecutive
        pair of values representing the (x,y) coordinates of a dot.  The
        coordinates are scaled to lie in the range [-1,1] and rotated so that
        the direction of coherent motion is zero degrees.
