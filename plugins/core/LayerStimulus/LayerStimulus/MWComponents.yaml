    Layers are useful only in conjuction with `masks <Mask Stimulus>`.

    A layer is a container for other stimuli.  When displayed, it first renders
    its child stimuli into a single scene, against a transparent background.  It
    then draws this composite scene on the stimulus display.  If one of its
    children is a mask, the "masked out" regions become transparent or semi-
    transparent "windows", through which any stimuli below the layer are
    visible.

    For example, when displayed together, the following stimuli produce a red
    circle inside a green square::

        rectangle the_background (
            color = 0,1,0
            x_size = 10
            )

        layer the_layer {
            rectangle (
                color = 1,0,0
                x_size = 10
                )
            mask (
                mask = ellipse
                x_size = 10
                )
        }

name: Mask Stimulus
signature: stimulus/mask
isa: Basic Transform Stimulus
description: |
    Masks are useful only in conjuction with `layers <Layer Stimulus>`.

    A mask obscures or erases any stimuli in its layer that lie below it.  The
    "masked out" regions become transparent or semi-transparent "windows",
    through which any stimuli below the layer are visible.  If the mask is
    `inverted`_, it will make a "hole" through the stimuli under it, allowing
    the stimuli beneath the layer to show through.

    For example, the following layer will produce a red ring with inner radius
    5 and outer radius 10::

        layer the_layer {
            circle (
                color = 1,0,0
                x_size = 20
                )
            mask (
                mask = ellipse
                inverted = true
                x_size = 10
                )
        }

  -
    name: inverted
    default: 'NO'
    description: >
        If ``YES``, the effect of the mask is inverted: Areas of the display
        that normally would be visible through the mask are hidden, and areas
        that normally would be hidden are visible.

    name: mean
    default: 0.0
    description: |
        Mean of Gaussian mask.

        This value determines the radial offset of the Gaussian peak from the
        center of the mask.  If non-zero, the peak will be a circle, rather than
        a point, and luminance will decrease both inside and outside the circle,
        producing a toroidal mask.
  -
    name: normalized
    default: 'NO'
    description: >
        If ``YES``, the Gaussian mask includes a multiplicative normalization
        term (``1/(std_dev*sqrt(2*pi))``).  If ``NO``, this term is omitted.
