name: RCB-LVDS Digital Input Channel
signature: iochannel/rcb_lvds_digital_input
isa: IOChannel
description: |
    Digital input channel on a `RCB-LVDS Device`.

    *Note*: RCB-LVDS digital channels are inputs from the perspective of the
    device, in that their values are recorded along with the amplifier channel
    data and streamed to the recording software.  However, from MWorks'
    perspective, they function as outputs and can be used to add time stamps or
    other information to the RCB-LVDS data stream.
parameters: 
  - 
    name: channel
    required: yes
    example: [3, '0,2,6', '1:4', '7,11:13,15']
    description: >
        Channel number(s) to control via assignment to the variable provided in
        `value`_.  Each channel number must be between 0 and 15 (inclusive).
  - 
    name: value
    required: yes
    description: |
        Variable from which to read channel state.  `Assigning <Assign
        Variable>` a value to the variable causes the channel state to be
        changed immediately.

        The state value is treated as a multi-bit word.  The least significant
        bit controls the state of the first channel specified in `channel`_ (0
        for low, 1 for high), the next bit controls the second channel, etc.
