    Interface to a `USB human interface device
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_human_interface_device_class>`_ (HID)
    class device.

    Appropriate values for the `usage_page`_ and `usage`_ parameters can be
    found in the `HID Usage Tables
    <http://www.usb.org/developers/hidpage#HID_Usage>`_.  Here are the values
    for a few common device types:

    =========== ========== =====
    Device type Usage page Usage
    =========== ========== =====
    Keyboard    1          6
    Joystick    1          4
    Gamepad     1          5
    =========== ========== =====
parameters: 
  - 
    name: usage_page
    required: yes
    example: 1
    description: HID usage page for the device
  - 
    name: usage
    required: yes
    example: 6
    description: HID usage for the device
  - 
    name: preferred_location_id
    default: 0
    description: >
        If MWorks finds multiple candidate devices for the given `usage_page`_
        and `usage`_, it will issue an error message that lists the product
        name, manufacturer name, and "location ID" for each matching device.  To
        select the desired device, set this parameter to the reported location
        ID of that device.
  - 
    name: log_all_input_values
    default: 'NO'
    description: >
        If ``YES``, MWorks will log (to the event stream and server console) all
        input values received from the device.  Each log message will include
        an associated element usage page and usage.  These usage page and usage
        values can be used to define a `USB HID Input Channel` for the input.

name: USB HID Input Channel
signature: iochannel/usbhid_generic_input_channel
isa: IOChannel
platform: macos
description: |
    Input channel on a `USB HID Device`.  Typically, a channel corresponds to a
    specific input (e.g. key, button, joystick axis) on the device.

    Appropriate values for the `usage_page`_ and `usage`_ parameters can be
    found in the `HID Usage Tables
    <http://www.usb.org/developers/hidpage#HID_Usage>`_.  However, in many
    cases, an easier method for determining the correct values is to set the
    device's ``log_all_input_values`` parameter to ``YES``, exercise the
    input(s) of interest, and record the usage page and usage values reported in
    the corresponding log messages.
parameters: 
  - 
    name: usage_page
    required: yes

  - 
    name: usage
    required: yes
    example: 44
    description: HID usage for the input
  - 
    name: value
    required: yes
    description: >
        Variable in which to store values received from the input.  Input values
        are always converted to an integer representation before being stored.
