description: A drifting grating stimulus
parameters: 
  - 
    name: direction
    default: 0.0
    description: Direction of drift (degrees)
  - 
    name: starting_phase
    default: 0.0
    description: Starting phase (degrees)

    name: spatial_frequency
    required: yes
    example: 1
    description: Spatial frequency (cycles per degree)
  - 
    name: speed
    required: yes
    example: 1
    description: Drift speed (degrees per second)
  - 
    name: grating_type
    required: yes
    options: [sinusoid, square, triangle, sawtooth]
    description: Grating type
  - 
    name: mask
    required: yes
    options: [rectangle, ellipse, gaussian]
    description: Mask type
  -
    name: inverted
    default: 'NO'
    description: >
        If ``YES``, sawtooth gratings will start high instead of low
  - 
    name: std_dev
    default: 1.0
    description: Standard deviation of Gaussian mask
  - 
    name: mean
    default: 0.0
    description: |
        Mean of Gaussian mask.

        This value determines the radial offset of the Gaussian peak from the
        center of the grating.  If non-zero, the peak will be a circle, rather
        than a point, and luminance will decrease both inside and outside the
        circle, producing a toroidal stimulus.
  -
    name: normalized
    default: 'YES'
    description: >
        If ``YES``, the Gaussian mask includes a multiplicative normalization
        term (``1/(std_dev*sqrt(2*pi))``).  If ``NO``, this term is omitted.
