name: NE-500 Syringe Pump Network
signature: iodevice/ne500
isa: IODevice
platform: macos
allowed_child: NE-500 Syringe Pump
description: >
    Used for interfacing to a network of `NE-500 syringe pumps
    <http://www.syringepump.com/oem.php#aa>`_, accessed via a serial-to-ethernet
    bridge or a USB-to-serial adapter
parameters: 
  - 
    name: address
    example:
      - '"10.0.254.254"'
      - /dev/cu.usbserial-FTH1RRH5
    description: |
        If `port`_ is provided, the address is taken to be a host name,
        and MWorks attempts to connect to the pump network via a
        `TCP <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol>`_
        socket.  Otherwise, the address is assumed to be a filesystem path that
        represents a serial port.

        If neither address nor port is provided, MWorks looks for a single,
        connected serial device.  If it finds one, it assumes it to be the
        desired pump network and attempts to connect.

    name: port
    example: 100

  - 
    name: response_timeout
    default: 100ms
    description: >
        Maximum time to wait for responses to pump commands (microseconds).  If
        no response is received in the allotted time, issue an error message.
  - 
    name: log_pump_commands
    default: 'YES'
    description: >
        If ``YES``, log all commands sent to and responses received from the
        pump network to the MWorks event stream and server console

signature: iochannel/ne500
isa: IOChannel
platform: macos
description: >
    Used for interfacing to a specific pump within a `NE-500 Syringe Pump
    Network`
parameters: 
  - 
    name: capability
    required: yes
    example: '00'
    description: Network address of pump (0 to 99)
  - 
    name: syringe_diameter
    required: yes
    example: 15.0
    description: Syringe diameter (millimeters)
  - 
    name: flow_rate
    required: yes
    example: 5
    description: Pumping rate (units given by `rate_unit`_)
  - 
    name: rate_unit
    options: [UM, MM, UH, MH]
    default: MM
    description: >
        Units of `flow_rate`_.  The options are uL/min, mL/min, uL/hr, and
        mL/hr.
  - 
    name: variable
    required: yes
    description: >
        Variable from which to read the volume to dispense.  Assigning a nonzero
        value to the variable causes MWorks to prepare the pump's onboard
        dispensing program (updating rate, volume, and direction as needed).
        If the pump network is `enabled <Start IO Device>`, pumping will then
        begin.
  - 
    name: volume_unit
    options: [UL, ML]
    description: |
        Volume units.

        If omitted, volume units are determined by `syringe_diameter`_.  If the
        syringe diameter is less than or equal to 14mm, UL is used.  Otherwise,
        ML is used.
