name: Python File Resource
signature: resource/python_file
isa: Resource
platform: macos
description: |
    A special type of `resource file <Resources>` that contains Python source
    code.

    The file is executed when the experiment loads.  The execution takes place
    after all experiment-defined `variables <Variables>` have been created, but
    before any other components are created.  Therefore, the Python code can set
    variable values or perform additional initialization tasks, and other
    components can make use of the results.
parameters: 
  - 
    name: path
    required: yes

name: Run Python Action
abstract: yes
isa: Action
platform: macos
parameters: 
  - 
    name: stop_on_failure
    default: 'NO'
    description: >
        If ``YES``, the experiment will stop automatically if Python execution
        fails

name: Run Python File
signature: action/run_python_file
isa: Run Python Action
description: |
    Execute the specified file as `Python <https://www.python.org>`_ source
    code.

    Within the Python code, use ``getvar`` to retrieve the value of an MWorks
    variable and ``setvar`` to set it, e.g.

    .. code:: python

        x = getvar('x')
        setvar('x', x + 1)
parameters: 
  - 
    name: path
    required: yes

description: |
    Execute the given string as `Python <https://www.python.org>`_ source code.

    Within the Python code, use ``getvar`` to retrieve the value of an MWorks
    variable and ``setvar`` to set it, e.g.

    .. code:: python

        x = getvar('x')
        setvar('x', x + 1)
